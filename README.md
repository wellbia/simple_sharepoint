Simple way to handle sharepoint with python.
Provides the ability to upload files and directories. 

## Installation

install the latest stable version using `pip`

```shell
$ pip install simple-sharepoint
```

## Usage

```python
from simple_sharepoint.client import Client

client_id = < CLIENT_ID >
client_secret = < CLIENT_SECRET >
base_url = < BASE URL >

c = Client(client_id, client_secret, base_url)
```

- See the link below for instructions on creating <b>CLIENT_ID</b> and <b>CLIENT_SECRET</b><br>
[Make Token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azureacs)

- <b>BASE_URL</b> refers to the main URL of the sharepoint.<br>
( format ) https://<SHAREPOINT_DOMAIN>/sites/<SHAREPOINT_SITE><br>
( ex ) `https://test.sharepoint.com/sites/testsite`


## Functions

### upload_file

A function that uploads a specific file to sharepoint.

```python
default_path = < SHAREPOINT_BASE_PATH >
src = < LOCAL_FILE_PATH >
dst = default_path + < SHAREPOINT_TARGET_PATH >

upload_file(src, dst)
```

- <b><i>SHAREPOINT_BASE_PATH</i></b> refers to the default path for a sharepoint document entry.<br>
( format ) /sites/<SHAREPOINT_SITE>/Shared Documents<br>
( ex ) `/sites/testsite/Shared Documents`

- <b><i>LOCAL_FILE_PATH</i></b> means the path to the file to be uploaded.<br>
( ex ) `/home/ubuntu/test.txt`

- <b><i>SHAREPOINT_TARGET_PATH</i></b> means the actual path to be uploaded to sharepoint.<br>
Think of the document menu in sharepoint as the root directory and enter the path thereafter.<br>
You do not need to include the file name.<br>
( ex ) `excel/example`

- If you run it as above, it will be uploaded as below.<br>
`/sites/testsite/Shared Documents/excel/example/test.txt`


### upload_dir

A function that uploads a particular directory and all its contents under the directory to sharepoint.

```python
default_path = < SHAREPOINT_BASE_PATH >
src = < LOCAL_DIR_PATH >
dst = default_path + < SHAREPOINT_TARGET_PATH >

upload_dir(src, dst)
```

- <b><i>SHAREPOINT_BASE_PATH</i></b>, <b><i>SHAREPIONT_TARGET_PATH</i></b> See item upload_file

- <b><i>LOCAL_DIR_PATH</i></b> means the path to the directory to be uploaded.<br>
( ex ) `/home/ubuntu/files`

### download_file

A function that downloads a specific file from the sharepoint.

```python
default_path = < SHAREPOINT_BASE_PATH >
src = default_path + < SHAREPOINT_TARGET_PATH >
dst = < LOCAL_FILE_PATH >

download_file(src, dst)
```

- <b><i>SHAREPOINT_BASE_PATH</i></b>, <b><i>SHAREPIONT_TARGET_PATH</i></b> See item upload_file

- The download_file function requires you to specify the file name to be stored in <b><i>LOCAL_FILE_PATH</i></b>.
( ex ) `/home/ubuntu/files/test.txt`


### download_dir

A function that downloads a particular directory in the sharepoint and all the contents under it.

```python
default_path = < SHAREPOINT_BASE_PATH >
src = default_path + < SHAREPOINT_TARGET_PATH >
dst = < LOCAL_DIR_PATH >

download_dir(src, dst)
```

- <b><i>SHAREPOINT_BASE_PATH</i></b>, <b><i>SHAREPIONT_TARGET_PATH</i></b>, <b><i>LOCAL_DIR_PATH</i></b> See item upload_dir
